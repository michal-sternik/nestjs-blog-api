## Features

- User registration and login with JWT-based authentication  
- Role-based access structure (secure endpoints)  
- CRUD operations for blog posts  
- User and post data validation using DTOs  
- Swagger documentation for easy API testing  

## Entities

- `User`: represents registered users of the blog  
- `Post`: represents blog posts created by users  

## Authentication

Authentication is handled using JWT tokens. Users must log in to receive a token which is required to access protected routes (like creating or editing posts). Passwords are securely hashed and validated.
